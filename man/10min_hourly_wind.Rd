\arguments{
  \item{filename}{A character vector, e.g.,filename='bmw1Series'.}
  \item{fcnname}{A function object for a distribution function.}
  \item{nrange}{A numeric vector with two numbers, stating upper and lower bound of the range, e.g., nrange=c(-5,5).}

\value{An object of problem1 will be a .tex file or a .tex file and a pdf file when set compile equal to TRUE.
The pdf file will be a plot with the following components:
xlab: "X".
Ylab: Discription of density function.
plot: A line of plot of the points.
